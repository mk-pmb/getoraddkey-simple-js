getoraddkey-simple
==================
If your collection is missing the slot you want to work with,
have it be created on the fly.

The "simple" edition is aimed to be small, fast and cover just
the most common use cases. If you need async factory functions
and custom preconfiguration, check out [getoraddkey-fancy][goa-fancy].

Inspired by [lodash feature request #2288](ld-is2288).
